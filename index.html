                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>The first-ever Coachella was held in October 1999 at the Empire Polo Field in Indio, California. Paul Tollett and Rick Van Santen of music promoter Goldenvoice founded the festival, 
                            hoping to attract the likes of 70,000 fans with a wide-ranging lineup of artists. The first Coachella lineup spanned multiple genres with standout performers like Beck, Rage Against The Machine, 
                            and Tool. The 1999 Coachella was ultimately not profitable, with the festival only selling around 25,000 tickets in total. The festival was canceled in 2000, but returned again in 2001 and has been 
                            charting its upward course ever since.
